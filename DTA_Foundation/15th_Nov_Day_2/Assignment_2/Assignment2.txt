3. Why do we use  ~  and >  symbols in css selectors?

div ~  p :It is general sibling combinator and similar to Adjacent sibling combinator. the difference is that the second selector does NOT have to immediately follow the first one means It will select all elements that is preceded by the former selector.

div > p : It will target elements which are DIRECT children of a particular element.
