                The Hyderabadi biryani needs no real introduction. Biryani has been a part of Hyderabadi cuisine tradition for close to 400 years. It is the staple to the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct.
                Our expert chef adds the right proportion of unique Indian spices to give the perfect aroma, taste and flavour that leaves our biryani with a distinguished appearance. We at hyderabadi bawarchi make sure the meat is tender and juicy with the rice stuffed in layers between the meat and spices and keep it on dum. Dum basically refers to letting the dish breathe in its own aroma or juices to make it more flavourful. Therefore large handis(cooking pots) are sealed with dough or cloth to trap the steam, which then cooks the meat or rice until tender. Rest assured you will have to taste it to believe it.
