2. What is the difference between undefined and not defined in JavaScript?
   "not defined" is usually caused by a typo, or by trying to access a variable that is out of scope or not defined. "undefined" is usually     caused by forgetting to assign a value to a variable.

3. Difference between ==  and ===?
   Double equals named as Equality Operator. Triple equals named as Identity / Strict equality Operator.	
   Double equals first convert the operands into the same type and then compare i.e comparison would perform once both the operands are of     the same type. This is also known as type coercion comparison. On the other hand, triple equals do not perform any type of conversion       before comparison and return true only if type and value of both operands are exactly the same.

   Eg.
   var a = true;
   var b = 1;
   var c = true;
   console.log (a == b); // first convert 1 into boolean true then compare
   console.log (a === c); // both are of same type no conversion required simple compare.
   console.log (a === b); // no conversion performed and type of both operands are not of same type so expected result is false.

4. What does the isNaN() function?

5. Difference between Client side JavaScript and Server side JavaScript?
   Client-side scripting                            	
   Runs on the user's computer, i .e. browser interprets the script
   Source code is visible to the user.	
   Used for validations and functionality for the user events
   Depends on the browser and version.
	
   Server-side scripting
   Runs on the web server
   Source code is not visible to the user because the output of a server-side program is an HTML page.
   Used for business logic and data access from the database. The pages are created dynamically.
   Doesn't depend on the client. Any server-side technology can be used.
