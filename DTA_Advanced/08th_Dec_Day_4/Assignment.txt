1. What is regular expression in javascript? How to validate email id using regular expression?

A regular expression is a pattern of characters. The pattern is used to do pattern-matching "search-and-replace" functions on text. In JavaScript, a RegExp Object is a pattern with Properties and Methods.

eg. let text = "Visit W3Schools";
let pattern = /w3schools/i;
let result = text.match(pattern);

Function to validate email

function validateEmail(email){
    const reg = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;

    if(reg.test(email)){
        return true;
    }
    alert('Please enter valid email.');
    return false;
}

2.  What is map() method in Array?   How to use map() method?
    The map() method in JavaScript creates an array by calling a specific function on each element present in the parent array. It is a non-mutating method.A function to be run for each array element and create a new array.

    array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

3.  Create a web page to define the functions for the following requirements:

        a.  Function to find out the no. of even numbers in the given array .
        b.  Function to find out power value  ( x power y)
        c.  Function to return no. of words in the given string.  

4.   Create a web page to perform the following operations on given array using Map() method :

			  var citiesArray  = [ "Hyderabad", "Mumbai",  "Bangalore", "Gurgaon"];
		
				a.  Get the item items in uppercase format     (Named)
				b.  Get the first three characters of the each item  (Anonymous)
				c.  Get  the items that should replace the "a" with "@"  (Arrow)
				
5. Find the details about following methods of Array:
		Find(),  FindIndex(),  Filter()

 The arr.find() method in Javascript is used to get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition. It checks all the elements of the array and whichever the first element satisfies the condition is going to print. This function will not work function having the empty array elements, and also does not change the original array.

Syntax:
array.find(function(currentValue, index, arr),thisValue);

The Array.findIndex() method is used to return the first index of the element in a given array that satisfies the provided testing function (passed in by the user while calling). Otherwise, if no data is found then the value of -1 is returned.
It does not execute the method once it finds an element satisfying the testing method.
It does not change the original array.
Syntax:

array.findIndex(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

The JavaScript Array filter() Method is used to create a new array from a given array consisting of only those elements from the given array which satisfy a condition set by the argument method. 

Syntax: 
array.filter(callback(element, index, arr), thisValue)
